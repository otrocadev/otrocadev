🙂 My name is Ot, thanks for taking the time to see my profile! I am mainly a Front-end dev, and I enjoy a lot cretating great solutions from the ideas I have!

💻 I have been programing for a long now, but this last year is when I started taking it seriously while I am studying to be a Software Engineer.

🧩 I consider myself a proactive person who enjoys continuously learning new technologies to add value. I firmly believe that the most important thing in life is having the right attitude to always improve and bring out the best version of yourself.

🤝 I feel very comfortable in team environments, as I believe that diverse perspectives and opinions usually lead to a better final result. As someone who believes in continuous growth, I am convinced that being part of a team is always a great opportunity to contribute value while learning new things (both technical and non-technical) from your teammates.
